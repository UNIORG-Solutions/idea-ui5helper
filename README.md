# ui5helper

This plugin adds some codeInsight and framework knowledge for Open- and SAPUI5 to IDEA IDEs.
It does not do much in its current state, it is not "production ready" and it will not save your time for
now.


### Things it may be able to do now (experimental):

 - XMLView: Go To Controller
 - Collapse the controller name in the XMLView


### Things that will (or will not) come:

 - Settings to enable or disable certain features
 - Understanding & support for the UI5 binding syntax incl. completion, references, syntax checking, ...
 - Indexer for UI5 classes including metadata and inheritance tree
 - <s>Go to Controller, </s>go to View, go to formatter, go to event handler, ...
 - support for manifest metadata like routes etc.
